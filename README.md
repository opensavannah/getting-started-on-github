# Basics and Getting Started
## A brief tutorial for non-technical Brigade members

##### [CARL V. LEWIS](http://github.com/carlvlewis), BRIGADE CAPTAIN FOR [OPEN SAVANNAH](http://opensavannah.org)
#### A [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) project.

### Background
I still recall the first time I used GitHub back in 2010 as a junior in college. I knew I could download helpful stuff from it for helping me build custom [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) themes, but that was about all I understood. I didn't know what a `fork` was or how to `clone` a `repo` (short for *repository,* which is basically a bucket filled with the code for a given project). Nor did I understand the value of `version control` in maintaining a history of edits. And the command line? That was uncharted territory altogether.

Today, I like to summarize GitHub to beginners and students as "sort of like a social network for programmers, but also like a portfolio, too." But, wait, you may be thinking: I'm not a programmer, so why should I learn GitHub? Well, GitHub isn't *just* for storing code; it also is useful for storing documentation, datasets and files of all types in an open-source environment with hundreds of thousands of users. Files like this tutorial, for example!

### Brigade use of GitHub
Open Savannah uses GitHub for three broad tasks:
+ Collaboration and code review
+ Documentation
+ File storage and sharing
Because of this, it will be helpful for everyone to understand the basics of GitHub and how it works. 

So, close your open browser tabs except for this one and prepare to follow along.

## Step 0: Create a GitHub account 

The first thing you'll want to do is create a free GitHub account.

Once you've done that, create a GitHub account [here](http://github.com).  (Accounts are free for public repositories, but there's a charge for private repositories.)

## Step 1: Use your GitHub account to sign into the Open Savannah homepage
Click 'Login' in the top right corner of page, then select `Sign in with GitHub`.
